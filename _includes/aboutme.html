      <p>You found me! I'm a self-employeed web developer, currently building a music-sharing platform on the side. Over the past few years I've completed General Assembly's Web Development Immersive, worked for American Express on the Digital Parterships team and graduated from McGill University. Before that I grew up in NYC and started my beginnings in the Hellenic Republic.</p>
